# Manage - A challange by Frontend Mentor

This is a Website I made using HTML and vanilla CSS to improve my Front-End skills. The layout of the website is a solution to the ["Manage landing page" challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/manage-landing-page-SLXqC6P5). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.
